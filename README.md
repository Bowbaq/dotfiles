osx-bootstrap
=============

Bootstrap for new OSX install

These files will install a bunch of great tools on your newly installed Mac. If it's not newly installed, you'll probably be able to use these anyway :)

Run install.sh to install Homebrew, cask, oh-my-zsh, and a bunch of great tools and apps. If you don't want all the apps I use, make sure fork this and edit the Brewfile and Caskfile to your liking.

Enjoy!
